My Inner Scope üåü
A self-reflection web application that helps users track their personal growth through daily diary entries and behavioral reflection.

Overview
My Inner Scope is a Flask-based web application designed to encourage self-improvement through daily reflection. Users write short diary entries about their actions and behaviors, then categorize them as either "encouraged behavior" or "something to change." The app gamifies the self-reflection process with points, streaks, and progress tracking.

Features

Streak tracking (current and longest)
Progress visualization with interactive charts
Analytics Dashboard:
Points over time (cumulative chart with zoom/pan)

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a `.env` file for environment variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///users.db
FLASK_ENV=development

# Optional: Analytics Integration
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-google-analytics-id
GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ID=your-search-console-id
```

Run the application:
bash
python run.py
Open your browser to http://localhost:5000
The SQLite database (users.db) will be created automatically on first run.

Database Schema

The application uses the following SQLAlchemy models for its database schema:

### User Table (`users`)
- `id`: Primary key (Integer)
- `email`: Unique user email (String)
- `_password`: Hashed password (String, internal representation)
- `user_name`: Optional display name (String)

### DiaryEntry Table (`diary_entry`)
- `id`: Primary key (Integer)
- `user_id`: Foreign key to User (Integer)
- `entry_date`: Date of entry (Date, defaults to today)
- `content`: Text content of the diary entry (Text)
- `rating`: Integer (`-1` for "want to change", `1` for "encouraged")

### DailyStats Table (`daily_stats`)
- `id`: Primary key (Integer)
- `user_id`: Foreign key to User (Integer)
- `date`: Date of the stats record (Date)
- `points`: Points earned that day (Integer, default 0)
- `current_streak`: Current consecutive day streak (Integer, default 0)
- `longest_streak`: All-time longest streak (Integer, default 0)
- `user_date_uc`: Unique constraint on `user_id` and `date`

### Goal Table (`goals`)
- `id`: Primary key (Integer)
- `user_id`: Foreign key to User (Integer)
- `category`: Enum (`GoalCategory`: Exercise, Learning, Mindfulness, Social, Productivity, Personal Development, Home, Creative, Custom)
- `title`: Goal title (String)
- `description`: Optional goal description (Text)
- `week_start`: Start date of the goal week (Date)
- `week_end`: End date of the goal week (Date)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of goal creation (DateTime)
- `status`: Enum (`GoalStatus`: active, completed, failed, default active)
- `progress_notes`: Optional notes on goal progress (Text)

## Dependency Security Checks

This project uses two tools to check for known security vulnerabilities in its Python dependencies:

- **safety**: Checks installed packages for known vulnerabilities.
- **pip-audit**: Audits dependencies for security issues using the Python Advisory Database.

### How to Run Security Checks Locally

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pip-audit
   ```
2. Run safety:
   ```bash
   safety check
   ```
3. Run pip-audit:
   ```bash
   pip-audit
   ```

### Automated Checks with GitHub Actions

Every time you push code or open a pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically run both `safety` and `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities. Results will appear in the "Checks" tab on GitHub. If issues are found, you will see a warning, but you can still merge your code. This helps you stay aware of security issues in your dependencies.
