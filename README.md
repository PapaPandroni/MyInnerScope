Aim for the Stars ðŸŒŸ
A self-reflection web application that helps users track their personal growth through daily diary entries and behavioral reflection.

Overview
Aim for the Stars is a Flask-based web application designed to encourage self-improvement through daily reflection. Users write short diary entries about their actions and behaviors, then categorize them as either "encouraged behavior" or "something to change." The app gamifies the self-reflection process with points, streaks, and progress tracking.

Features
Current Functionality
User Authentication: Registration and login system with password hashing
Daily Diary Entries: Users can write reflective entries about their day
Behavioral Rating: Each entry is rated as positive behavior (+5 points) or behavior to change (+2 points)
Gamification Elements:
Daily point system
Streak tracking (current and longest)
Progress visualization with interactive charts
Analytics Dashboard:
Points over time (cumulative chart with zoom/pan)
Weekly trend analysis
Day-of-week performance patterns
Top performing days with entry details
Diary Reading: Chronological diary view with navigation between entries
Technical Stack
Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy
Database: SQLite
Frontend: Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
Authentication: Werkzeug password hashing
Visualization: Chart.js with Luxon for time handling
