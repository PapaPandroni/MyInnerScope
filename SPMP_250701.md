        - `static/css/progress/` - Feature-specific styles (progress.css)
        - `static/js/shared/` - Cross-feature scripts (cookie_consent.js, tour-controller.js)
        - `static/js/goals/` and `static/js/progress/` - Feature-specific scripts
    - **Templates Reorganized**: Created feature-based subdirectories:
        - `templates/auth/` (login, register), `templates/diary/`, `templates/goals/`
        - `templates/legal/` (privacy, terms), `templates/main/` (index, about, donate)
        - `templates/progress/`, `templates/reader/`, `templates/user/` (settings, delete)
        - `templates/shared/` (base.html, _navbar.html), `templates/errors/` (unchanged)
    - **References Updated**: All 40+ `render_template()` calls and 25+ `url_for()` static file references updated to new paths.
    - **Base Template**: Updated all templates to extend `shared/base.html` and include `shared/_navbar.html`.
