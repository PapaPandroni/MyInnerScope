## 1. Foundational Tooling & Infrastructure

### 1.1. Database Migrations
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Action**: Ensure all future database schema modifications are managed via `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade`.

### 1.2. Testing Framework
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Action**: Continuously write comprehensive unit, integration, and functional tests for new and existing features to ensure code stability and prevent regressions.

## 2. Security Hardening & Compliance

### 2.1. Security Hardening
- **CSRF Protection for AJAX Requests**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Implementation**: Verified that `app/static/js/progress/export.js` correctly includes CSRF token in POST requests. Other JavaScript files do not make unprotected AJAX POST requests. The `meta[name="csrf-token"]` tag is correctly present in `base.html`.
- **Rate Limiting**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Action**: Applied comprehensive rate limits to all sensitive blueprints (`auth`, `diary`, `goals`, `user`, `progress`, `reader`) in `routes/__init__.py`. Added a new test file `tests/test_security.py` to verify the implementation.
- **Dependency Security Audit**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Implementation**: `safety check` and `pip-audit` performed. Identified `pillow` vulnerability (PYSEC-2025-61) and upgraded `pillow` to `11.3.0`. All known vulnerabilities addressed.

### 2.2. Legal & Compliance (GDPR Focus)
- **Privacy Policy and Cookie Consent**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Implementation**: Content of `privacy.html` and `terms.html` updated to accurately reflect existing features and GDPR compliance. Cookie consent mechanism in `cookie_consent.js` verified to be sufficient for essential cookies.
- **User Data Deletion (Right to Erasure)**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Implementation**: Existing test suite (`tests/test_routes/test_user.py`) thoroughly verifies that the "Delete Account" feature performs a full cascading delete of all associated user data.
- **Data Portability**:
    - **Status**: Completed.
    - **Action**: Verify the completeness and accuracy of exported data for all user-related information.

## 3. Code Quality & Refactoring

### 3.1. Project Structure and File Naming
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Action**:
    - Create an `app` directory and move core application files (`config.py`, `models/`, `routes/`, `static/`, `templates/`, `utils/`) into it. Rename `app.py` to `run.py` in the root.
    - Complete renaming of all files and directories to `snake_case` (e.g., `custom_css.css` to `main.css`, `read_diary.html` to `reader.html`).
    - Update `GEMINI.md` to reflect the final project structure and file names.

### 3.2. Python Code Style
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Implementation**: 
    - Applied `black` code formatter to the entire project (41 files reformatted).
    - Confirmed all variables and functions already follow `snake_case` convention.
    - Added comprehensive type hints to all function definitions across routes, models, forms, and utilities.
    - Converted existing docstrings to Google-style format with proper Args/Returns sections.
    - Created `pyproject.toml` configuration for black and isort.
    - All 120 tests pass with new code style improvements.

### 3.3. Route and Helper Organization
- **Status**: Planned.
- **Implementation Plan**: 
    - Analyzed current route structure: 8 route files with complex cross-dependencies between helpers.
    - Identified shared utilities used by multiple features (goal and progress helpers).
    - Created comprehensive refactoring plan documented in `refactor.md`.
    - Proposed 5-phase implementation strategy with feature-based packages.
    - Plan addresses cross-feature dependencies and maintains all 120 tests.
- **Next Steps**: Execute the phased implementation plan when ready to proceed.

### 3.4. Static and Template File Organization
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Static Files Reorganized**: Implemented feature-based organization with `shared/` subdirectories for cross-cutting concerns:
        - `static/css/shared/` - Cross-feature styles (base.css, tour.css, goals.css)
        - `static/css/progress/` - Feature-specific styles (progress.css)
        - `static/js/shared/` - Cross-feature scripts (cookie_consent.js, tour-controller.js)
        - `static/js/goals/` and `static/js/progress/` - Feature-specific scripts
    - **Templates Reorganized**: Created feature-based subdirectories:
        - `templates/auth/` (login, register), `templates/diary/`, `templates/goals/`
        - `templates/legal/` (privacy, terms), `templates/main/` (index, about, donate)
        - `templates/progress/`, `templates/reader/`, `templates/user/` (settings, delete)
        - `templates/shared/` (base.html, _navbar.html), `templates/errors/` (unchanged)
    - **References Updated**: All 40+ `render_template()` calls and 25+ `url_for()` static file references updated to new paths.
    - **Base Template**: Updated all templates to extend `shared/base.html` and include `shared/_navbar.html`.
    - **Testing**: All 125 tests pass with new file organization structure.

### 3.5. HTML and JavaScript Style
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Implementation**:
    - **HTML IDs Updated**: Converted all `id` attributes from `kebab-case` to `snake_case`:
        - Progress page: `entry-{{ day.date }}-{{ loop.index }}` → `entry_{{ day.date }}_{{ loop.index }}`
        - Data scripts: `points-data`, `weekday-data`, `goal-stats-data` → `points_data`, `weekday_data`, `goal_stats_data`
        - Form elements: `diary-form`, `rating-input`, `char-counter` → `diary_form`, `rating_input`, `char_counter`
        - Interactive elements: `show-more-btn-{{ day_index }}` → `show_more_btn_{{ day_index }}`
    - **Data Attributes**: Verified all `data-*` attributes already follow proper conventions (mostly Bootstrap `data-bs-*`).
    - **JavaScript Functions**: Converted all function names to `snake_case`:
        - `toggleEntry()` → `toggle_entry()`
        - `toggleExtraEntries()` → `toggle_extra_entries()`
        - `toggleExtraGoals()` → `toggle_extra_goals()`
        - Class methods: `setupData()` → `setup_data()`, `initCharts()` → `init_charts()`
    - **JavaScript Variables**: Updated all variable names to `snake_case`:
        - `categorySelect` → `category_select`, `titleInput` → `title_input`
        - `pointsData` → `points_data`, `weekdayConfig` → `weekday_config`
        - `progressData` → `progress_data`, `goalStatsData` → `goal_stats_data`
    - **CSS Classes**: Updated corresponding CSS selectors for renamed elements.
    - **Comprehensive Style Review**: Conducted systematic review and fixed additional missed items:
        - Chart property names: `this.pointsChart` → `this.points_chart`
        - Chart method names: `initPointsChart()` → `init_points_chart()`
        - Data structure consistency: Fixed template JSON properties to match JavaScript expectations
        - Global variables: `window.wordcloudData` → `window.wordcloud_data`, `window.tourConfig` → `window.tour_config`
        - Template assignments: Updated all template-to-JavaScript data passing
        - Tour system: Fixed dynamically created element IDs and references
    - **Testing**: All 125 tests pass with comprehensive style consistency updates.

### 3.6. Database Refactoring
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Implementation**: 
    - Updated SQLAlchemy model definitions to use `snake_case` and plural for table names: `user` → `users`, `goal` → `goals`.
    - Created dual-database compatible migration script (`migrations/versions/033faf89f4e5_*`) that handles both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production).
    - Applied database migration successfully to rename tables without data loss in both environments.
    - Updated all foreign key references in models: `'user.id'` → `'users.id'`.
    - Verified migration works correctly on Railway PostgreSQL production database.
    - All 120 tests pass with new schema structure.

### 3.7. Final Review and Cleanup
- **Status**: Not Started.
- **Action**:
    - Run all tests to ensure no functionality is broken.
    - Conduct a final review of the entire codebase for consistency with the style guide.
    - Remove any empty or unused files and directories.
    - Update `README.md` to reflect the new project structure and setup instructions.

## 4. Technical Debt & Performance

### 4.1. Database Performance
- **Status**: Not Started.
- **Action**: Add explicit database indexes to frequently queried columns (e.g., foreign keys, date columns) to improve read query performance.

### 4.2. Centralize Flash Message Handling
- **Status**: Partially Completed.
- **Action**: Consider centralizing the logic for `flash` messages into a helper function or dedicated utility for consistency and easier management.

### 4.3. Review Datetime Usage for Consistency
- **Status**: Partially Completed.
- **Action**: Review all instances of `datetime.now().date()` and `date.today()` to ensure consistent and appropriate use, especially concerning timezone awareness for date-only comparisons.

### 4.4. Progress Analytics Bug Fixes
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Implementation**: 
    - **Fixed Weekday Insights Logic**: Corrected "Average Points by Day of Week" chart unlock mechanism to require diary entries on 2+ different weekdays rather than points earned on different days.
    - **Added Progress Tracking**: Implemented dynamic progress display showing actual diary entry progress (e.g., "1/2 days completed") instead of hardcoded values.
    - **Separated Unlock vs Display Logic**: Chart now unlocks based on diary entry patterns (encouraging writing) but displays comprehensive point data from all sources.
    - **Enhanced Testing**: Added comprehensive tests covering all scenarios including edge cases where users have daily stats but insufficient diary entries.

- **Action**: Implement remaining features:
    - Email verification and password reset functionality.
    - Dark/light mode toggle.
    - Clickable "points today" to see detailed point breakdown.
    - Clickable "opportunities for growth" and "keep doing this" to see corresponding diary entries.
