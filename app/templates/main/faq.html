                                        <strong>Valued Direction</strong> is a core philosophy from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #00d4ff;">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</a>. Unlike specific goals with finish lines, valued directions are <strong>ongoing aspirational paths</strong>, such as:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>"Being a better parent"</li>

                                        There's no "completion" of such directions, but every action you take either moves you <strong>closer to or further from</strong> your valued direction. This continuous evaluation is the key mindset we aim to foster.
